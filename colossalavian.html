            <h1>Colossal Avian - 30lb Featherweight "Hammer Saw"</h1>
            <p class="larger"> Colossal Avian is my flagship 30lb robot. Originally born as my college team's senior year robot, I and 2 other close friends on the team have been upgrading, maintaining, and competing with the robot. 

            Colossal Avian is a hammer saw. This archetype features a spinning blade mounted at the end of an arm. This spinning blade gets swung down onto the tops of other robots and is designed to crumple top armor or other areas not as well protected as the sides and the front.

            <h2>Design Narrative</h2>

            <h4>Background</h4>
            <p> This robot has been through more iterations than I can count, with tons of small improvements and redesigns over time. For the sake of brevity, this post will cover the latest state of the design, with some relevant context sprinkled here and there from competition/design history.
            </p>

            <h4>Chassis + Drive</h4>
            <p>
            Avian's central chassis structure is relatively simple, composed of machined 2024 aluminum plates that fit together via tab-and-slot, as well as some screw fasteners. This chassis construction is lightweight and rigid. Although it doesn't take impact well, that is the job of the exterior armor. 
            The robot's exterior armor makes heavy use of TPU plastic which is moounted to the aluminum. No critical components (weapon and drive) have any direct connection to the TPU, allowing it to be entirely sacrificial.

            For top and bottom plates the material of choice is carbon fiber for stiffness + low mass. Previously aluminum was used for these plates, but the weight savings of carbon drove a change. 

            The upright plates in the middle can slide vertically out of the robot in order to remove the weapon system for maintainence. The entire weapon system is packaged together as a self-contained module.

            Avian is very wide so that it is difficult to get around to the sides of the robot. The goal is to always remain faced toward the opponent so they they are in the strike zone and to let the front-end armor package handle head to head engagements.
            </p>
            <h4>Configurations</h4>

            Avian has two main front armor packages to deal with two common robot archetypes.

            Forks - The fork armor package is designed to deal with vertically spinning robots. The fork armor package features thick steel forks that ride low on the ground and are hard for vertical spinning weapons to grab or bite. They are long to win over most opposing verts also running forks. They also serve to win the ground game battle and to disrupt the mobility of opponents.
            The forks are soft-mounted to the rest of the robot. Large TPU blocks mount the forks and serve as strain-relief when the forks get hit. Since they are allowed to flex, they can get hit and deflect in their mounting a significant amount without reflecting significant load to the mounting structure. 

            Additionally, "stoppers" can be placed at an adjustable distance on the forks. These stoppers are designed to stop the opponent from getting too close to our robot. By placing the stoppers further than the opponent's weapon reach, we can prevent their weapon from hitting Avian, letting us freely push them around and engage without taking risks.



            Wedge - The enemy of a horizontally spinning weapon is a hard slanted surface. The wedge configuration is put together with welded AR500 3/16" plates. This wear-plate material has excellent hardness + tooughness and is an ideal armor material. By putting this this thick wedge at the front of the robot, we can drive into horizontally spinning opponents without wory and deflect their hits. 
            This wedge is also soft-mounted using TPU mounting blocks to help absorb shock and to allow some amount of deformation to prevent high forces on impact.

            <center><p class=dark-grey-text><i>Robot with its chassis transparent to show drive system.</i></p></center>
            <p>A driving design constraint was size. The reduction had to be packed into a small enough package in order to keep the size of the frame down, saving weight. Using pinions that were as small as possible, and making smart use of solidworks sketches allowed me to position the components and choose pulley, gear and belt sizes to reduce the overall footprint of the gearing.
            A previous iteration of this robot was very overweight and fragile due to improper size constraints, so this was a critical item to get right. (Scroll down below for this previous iteration)
            </p>
            <p>

            In choosing drive electronics, I proritized finding low "Kv" motors which would have a low speed and produce high torque from low current so that the required gearing would be less. In addition, they should be lightweight and be in a suitable package to fit well into the robot. Yet, they needed to be plenty powerful: I had decided this robot's gimmick would be its overwhelming drive power. The 2004 drone motors I found were the best option that would fit the bill. Coming in at only ~16g and outputting several hundred watts, they certainly did the job.
            </p>
            <h4>Arm</h4>

            </div>
            <p>
            For the weapon system, I went with a "drum" or "egg-beater" spinner design. This consists of a wide vertically spinning hunk of material that hits other robots upwards. Its width allows the driver to be somewhat imprecise with the aim of the weapon.
            </p>
        
            <p>
            The weapon body is made from 7075 Aluminum for additional hardness and stiffness, and alloy steel flat-head screws are used as hard impactors for striking other robots. The weapon is constructed with an aluminum inner body with screw impactors to facilite ease of manufacturing and help reduce costs. Ideally a weapon could be made and machined completely out of a steel-billet and then hardened, but it would cost quite a bit!
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>
                As an exercise in improving my machining skills, I milled the first iteration of the weapon on our school's bridgeport mill over 6 grueling hours. Knowing the requirements for my part, I could set up my machining operations and tolerances such that I could ensure that critical tolerances were hit. Having a metal weapon to show off at competitions which I had machined was a rewarding experience, but after seeing how little I could buy a weapon CNC machined overseas, I had my next iterations made that way.
            </p>
            <h4>Weapon Blade</h4>
            <p>
            The chassis on the robot features a center section constructed of 3 interlocking pieces: A center-body, and two upright supports that that slot in. The chassis is constructed in multiple parts to facilitate better 3D-printing of the frame, and to optimally orient layer lines so that a crack cannot propogate through layer lines and crack an upright.
            </p>
            <center><img src="images/eclipsechassis.png" style="width:70%" alt="" class = "materialboxed"></center>
            <p>
            As for materials, the chassis is made from CoPA nylon which has excellent impact resistance for a 3D printed material, and it is further treated after printing by boiling the material which hydrates and anneals the nylon, greatly increasing its toughness.
            The side wheel-guard armor pieces are not critical for the structure, and so they are made from TPU, a flexible 3D printed material which is incredibly resilient to impacts and squishes and deforms to absorb the shock of weapon impacts.
            </p>

            <h4>Design Iterations</h4>
            <p>
            In order to get to the current refined design of Eclipse/Moonshot, there were previous iterations which were built and that I learned from. Most notably, the original version of the design took on a very different form. The robot was much larger than the current iteration, and had to be printed with very thin walls in order to make weight. This was the critical issue with this design, I had not put enough work into optimizing the size of the robot, and as a result it was incredibly fragile.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
            This design did not perform spectacularly, but I gained some important information. I learned that decreasing the size would be necessary for success. And also importantly, I had learned much more about what gear ratio would be required, and more about the maximum torque and power that the motors I supplied could output. The robot was very twitchy and not super responsive, meaning I probably needed a touch more torque than I currently had, but the robot drive around without overworking its motors, so I knew I was at least in the correct ballpark. In the second iteration, I knew I had to shoot for a slightly higher reduction than what I had, but I was not off by much.
            </p>
